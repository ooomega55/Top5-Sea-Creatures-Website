    <h2>Information About Seals:</h2>
    
    <ul class="left">
        <li>"Earless" seals lack an external ear flap, present on fur seals and sea lions, but they still have ears present beneath the surface of the skin.</li>
        <li>Mothers are more responsive to the calls of their own pup than to non-filial pups after only three days. Mother seals' responses are also varied.</li>
        <li>Research on hooded seals illustrated a drop in brain temperature by 3 degrees Celsius over the course of a fifteen minute dive.</li>
        <li>Because seals are typically found along coastlines, they primarily consume fish, squid, and shrimp, as well as other crustaceans, mollusks, and zooplankton organisms.</li>
        <li>While humans acquire it from burning tobacco, researchers think seals' blood carbon monoxide levels are connected to their deep dives.</li>
    </ul>
