    <h2>Information About Axolotls:</h2>

    <ul class="left">
        <li>They are aquatic, and although they posses rudimentary lungs, they breathe primarily through their gills and, to a lesser extent, their skin.</li>
        <li>If axolotls spend prolonged periods of time in shallow water, their gills may be absorbed and they can begin using their lungs on land. However, if axolotls are in deep water for long, they will keep their gills for the remainder of their lives, or until they move to shallow water for a long period of time.</li>
        <li>Their average lifespan is 10-15 years.</li>
        <li>Axolotls have amazing healing abilities. Normal wound healing in animals occurs through the growth of scar tissue, and this means that most animals won't re-grow a lost limb. However, the axolotl is fully capable of complete limb re-growth.</li>
        <li>They feed off of small aquatic creatures including worms, insects, crustaceans, and small fishes.</li>
    </ul>
